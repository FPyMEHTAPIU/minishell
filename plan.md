# Minishell Project Plan

## Overview of Minishell Requirements
- **Features**:
  1. Interactive shell with a prompt.
  2. Command execution (absolute, relative paths, and `PATH` lookup).
  3. Handle built-ins (`cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, etc.).
  4. Pipes (`|`) and redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`).
  5. Environment variables (`$VAR`) and `$?` handling.
  6. Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+\`).
  7. Memory management: No leaks.

- **Constraints**:
  - Limited to one global variable (for signal handling).
  - No undefined behavior (segfaults, double frees, etc.).

---

## Work Distribution
### Person A (Pipes and Redirection Expert)
- Pipes (`|`) and redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`).
- Command execution via `fork`, `execve`, and `dup2`.
- File descriptor management and cleanup.

### Person B (Signals and Built-ins Expert)
- Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+\`).
- Parsing environment variables (`$VAR` and `$?`).
- Implementation of built-ins (`cd`, `echo`, etc.).

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
**(Pair Work)**  
**Goal**: Set up the basic shell loop and minimal command execution.

1. **Basic Shell Loop**:
   - Display a prompt and wait for user input using `readline`.
   - Split the input into commands and arguments.
   - Execute a single command using `fork` and `execve`.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle invalid commands (e.g., `command not found`).
   - Add a minimal error message for debugging.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test simple commands like `ls`, `pwd`, and `echo`.

---

### Phase 2: Parsing and Built-ins
**Person A**:
- Implement a tokenizer to split the input into commands and arguments.
- Handle special characters (e.g., `|`, `<`, `>`, etc.), marking tokens for later processing.

**Person B**:
- Implement built-ins:
  - `cd`: Change directories (`chdir`).
  - `pwd`: Print the current working directory (`getcwd`).
  - `echo`: Print arguments (support `-n` option).
  - `exit`: Exit the shell.
- Implement `$?` handling to store and display the last command's exit status.

**Integration**:
- Test built-ins and basic parsing together.
- Verify that commands and built-ins execute in the same shell loop.

---

### Phase 3: Pipes and Redirections
**Person A**:
- Implement pipes (`|`):
  - Create pipes using `pipe()`.
  - Redirect input/output between processes using `dup2`.
  - Chain multiple commands (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3`).

- Implement redirections:
  - Input (`<`) and output (`>`, `>>`) redirection using `open` and `dup2`.
  - Heredoc (`<<`) implementation with delimiter reading.

**Person B**:
- Manage edge cases:
  - Test combinations of pipes and redirections (`cmd1 < infile | cmd2 > outfile`).
  - Handle invalid syntax (e.g., unmatched quotes, incomplete commands).
- Assist with file descriptor cleanup and ensure no memory leaks.

---

### Phase 4: Environment Variables and Expansions
**Person A**:
- Parse and expand environment variables (`$VAR`) in commands.
- Add support for exporting and unsetting variables via `export` and `unset`.

**Person B**:
- Manage special variables:
  - `$?`: Track the last command's exit status.
  - Handle `$VAR` expansion in quotes (`"text $VAR text"`).

---

### Phase 5: Signal Handling and Interactive Features
**Person B**:
- Implement signal handling:
  - `Ctrl+C`: Interrupts the current command and displays a new prompt.
  - `Ctrl+D`: Exits the shell.
  - `Ctrl+\`: Does nothing in interactive mode.
- Use `signal` or `sigaction` for proper handling.

**Person A**:
- Ensure signals donâ€™t interfere with pipes or redirections.
- Test signal handling during active processes (e.g., while waiting for input or executing a pipeline).

---

### Phase 6: Debugging and Testing
**(Pair Work)**  
- Test all features together:
  - Pipes and redirections (`cmd1 | cmd2 > file`).
  - Environment variables (`echo $HOME`).
  - Built-ins (`cd`, `pwd`, etc.).
  - Signal handling during interactive and command execution modes.
- Use tools like `valgrind` to ensure no memory leaks.
- Stress-test the shell with edge cases and complex command combinations.

| 5       | Signals and built-ins        | Debug pipes and redirections        | Handle signals (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`) |
| 6       | Testing and debugging        | Shared                              | Shared                              |

---

## Final Notes
- **Integration Points**:
  - Regularly integrate and test work to avoid conflicts.
  - Ensure consistent handling of edge cases across parsing, execution, and cleanup.

- **Leverage Past Experience**:
  - Use file descriptor management skills from **Pipex** for pipes and redirections.
  - Apply **Minitalk's** signal expertise to handle signals smoothly.

Implementation Notes
Global Variable Usage
Use only one global variable for signal handling
Use volatile sig_atomic_t type
Only store signal number information
Key Exit Status Codes
130: SIGINT (ctrl-C)
131: SIGQUIT (ctrl-)
0: Normal termination
Important Considerations
Interactive Mode Detection
Always check isatty() for interactive mode
Handle signals differently in parent and child processes
Signal Handler Implementation
Restore default signal handling in child processes
Use write() instead of printf() in signal handlers
Keep signal handlers as simple as possible
Readline Management
Use rl_replace_line("", 0) to clear line
Use rl_on_new_line() for prompt positioning
Use rl_redisplay() to show changes
Clear history before exiting
Process Management
Handle signals in both parent and child processes
Properly clean up child processes on termination
Reset signal handlers in child processes
